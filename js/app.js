Final Project
Download the Final Project Zip file below.

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require some very light modifications of the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.



Project Requirements:

- The game randomly shuffles the cards.

- A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.

- Users should not be able to open more than 2 cards can be open at one time.

- Users should not be able to open a card that is already open or matched.

- A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.

- Upon winning the game, the user should be presented with a SweetAlert alert, indicating that they have won the game.

- A user can restart the game at any time by pressing the restart button. This will cause all the cards to be hidden again.

- The game should display the current number of moves a user has made. A move is considered to have occured when 2 cards have been shown to the user, and either determined to be a match or a non-match.

- Comments should be present in the code and effectively explain a longer code procedure when necessary.

- Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting including proper indentation, thoughtful 
variable names.

- The game displays a star rating (from 1 to at least 3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it should display at least 3 stars. After some number of moves, it should change to a lower star rating. After a few more moves, it should change to a even lower star rating (down to 1). The number of moves needed to change the rating is up to you, but it should happen at some point. (A star should be removed every 15 moves)


Submission:

The solution should be submitted as .zip file that includes the HTML, JS and CSS files.
The .zip file should contain your first and last name.
Your .zip file should be uploaded to the course portal, no later than 3:15 PM, Tuesday, October 30th, 2018
Late assignments will be penalized by 10% per 24-hours late.


TIPS:

Adding the .show and .open class will flip a card over and display it's icon.
Adding a .match class to a card and removing the .show and .open classes will cause the card to turn into a match
